test1.txt

description:
This test case is designed in such a way that, no cow get painted by any starting paint ball.
Some of the paint ball triggers other paint balls, but non of them colors any of the cow.
so, in this case the Graph is created such that edge exists only between paint balls.
so, after running test1, results will look like this:

Field of Dreams
---------------
BLUE connectedTo: ['RED', 'GREEN']
RED connectedTo: ['BLUE']
GREEN connectedTo: ['BLUE']

Beginning simulation...
Triggering BLUE paint ball...
	 RED paint ball is triggered by BLUE paint ball
	 GREEN paint ball is triggered by BLUE paint ball
Triggering RED paint ball...
	 BLUE paint ball is triggered by RED paint ball
	 GREEN paint ball is triggered by BLUE paint ball
Triggering GREEN paint ball...
	 BLUE paint ball is triggered by GREEN paint ball

Results:
No cows were painted by any starting paint ball!

test2.txt

description:
This test case is designed in such a way that, there will be tie between multiple paint balls
for optimal result. In this test case, triggering of RED and YELLOW paint balls, both colors cows
with 4 colors. So, here we choose one of these paint ball as optimal solution.(In this case RED.)
so, after running test2, results will look like this:

Field of Dreams
---------------
BLUE connectedTo: ['Babe']
Babe connectedTo: []
RED connectedTo: ['Daisy', 'Milka', 'GREEN']
Daisy connectedTo: []
Milka connectedTo: []
GREEN connectedTo: ['BLUE', 'Milka']
YELLOW connectedTo: ['Fauntleroy', 'Gaumata', 'Gaiya']
Fauntleroy connectedTo: []
Gaumata connectedTo: []
Gaiya connectedTo: []

Beginning simulation...
Triggering BLUE paint ball...
	Babe is painted BLUE!
Triggering RED paint ball...
	Daisy is painted RED!
	Milka is painted RED!
	GREEN paint ball is triggered by RED paint ball
	Milka is painted GREEN!
Triggering GREEN paint ball...
	BLUE paint ball is triggered by GREEN paint ball
	Babe is painted BLUE!
	Milka is painted GREEN!
Triggering YELLOW paint ball...
	Fauntleroy is painted YELLOW!
	Gaumata is painted YELLOW!
	Gaiya is painted YELLOW!

Results:
Triggering the RED paint ball is the best choice with 4 total paint on the cows:
	Fauntleroy's colors: {}
	Milka's colors: {'RED', 'GREEN'}
	Gaumata's colors: {}
	Babe's colors: {'BLUE'}
	Gaiya's colors: {}
	Daisy's colors: {'RED'}

test3.txt

description:
This test case is designed such way that, There will no paintball and just cows in the input.
So, in this case graph with no edges will be created. So, after running test3, results will look like this:

Field of Dreams
---------------
Daisy connectedTo: []
Fauntleroy connectedTo: []
Babe connectedTo: []
Milka connectedTo: []
Jaadu connectedTo: []

Beginning simulation...

Results:
No cows were painted by any starting paint ball!
