This program draws a forest and a house. Number of trees is taken as input from the use.
Type of the trees are selected at random while drawing them. User can specify if the house is present
initially. if it is present then the position is selected at random based on number of trees.
Initially it draws forest at night with trees, house nad moon.
After drawing forest at night it calculates the amount of timber available and uses it to make(draw)
bigger house during day time.
